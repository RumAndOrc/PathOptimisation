# Path Optimisation

## MapMaker

This will be a node editor to represent junctions on a map 

### Key features:
* distances between nodes will be to scale
* lines will be colour coded 
  * black for distance is to-scale
  * red for some hindrance making the path more difficult than the default distance
  * blue for an easier than default distance
* distances will be rounded to integers for simplicity


## Optimiser

Initially this will implement Dijkstra's algorithm, but I have some ideas to modify it. Given that this project is mainly for learning git and for the love of coding I will probably end up at some other well known algorithm without realising. Fun either way.
